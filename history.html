            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West" id="kanyefacts">Kanye West</a> is most notably known
                as
                one
                of the best rappers/producers alive. From his lyrical genius to his fresh clothing line, there is almost
                nothing this man cannot do.
                <br>
                <br>Have you ever wondered if his feelings in his lyrics are positive or negative? Well that is what
                this
                page
                is dedicated to. Let's see what makes Kanye West do his Kanye Best.
                <br>
                <br>Take a look at a sentiment analysis of his top 11 songs. These songs are certified
                multi-platinum by the <a
                    href="https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=kanye+west&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=Single&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=M&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH&col=highest_level&ord=desc#search_section"
                    id="kanyefacts">Recording Industry Association of America® (RIAA)</a>. Here is a little key before
                we go
                investigate: the middle line represents neutrality, and the left is negative whereas the right is
                positive.

        <div class="hbody1">
            <p>In the analysis above, it is intersting to see the song titles and how relevant they are to the
                sentiment. Two of his saddest songs, "Love Lockdown" and "Heartless," recieved no Grammy's that year but
                are
                still within his top 7 songs of all time.
                <br>
                <br>Another interesting point of this analysis was that the lyrics were analyzed by words and not by
                sentences. Therefore, songs like "Gold Digger" may have recieved a different score if a different
                algorithm was used.
                <br>
                <br>Futhermore, two songs, "Ni**gas in Paris" and "All of the Lights" <a

                    id="kanyefacts">won the most Grammy's</a> out of the
                bunch and yet are on two different sides of the spectrum.
                <br>
                <br>The R package used for this sentiment analysis was "sentimentr." The lyrics were gathered from
                <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/" id="kanyefacts">AZlyrics.com</a> and from <a
                    href="https://www.genius.com/" id="kanyefacts">Genius.com</a>.
